# smartending

This is a passion project app for a class (bartending) I am taking for fun. The goal of the app is to display images of the different drinks we're learning about and give useful information about them. This way, we can study the drinks and learn the proper way to create each one. 

The application's name credit goes to Kellie Franzblau!
